<p>Greasemonkey 0.6.4 is available as an archive only. Use at your own 
risk. For safest results, always use the 
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/">latest 
release</a>.</p>

<h3><a 
href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/extensions/greasemonkey/greasemonkey-0.6.4-fx.xpi">Install Greasemonkey 
0.6.4</a></h3>

<p>This is the first official release with support for Firefox 1.5. The major 
change is that, with the exception of <a 
href="../authoring.html#unsafeWindow">unsafeWindow</a>, all 
objects that user scripts have access to are <a 
href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XPCNativeWrapper">XPCNativeWrappers
</a>. This makes user scripts vastly more secure since there is no way for 
content 
scripts to hijack function calls.

<h4>Other Changes</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong>Monkey Menu</strong> - Right click on the monkey for the list of 
scripts which match this page. You can easily enable and disable them from this 
location. You can also enable or disable all of Greasemonkey, or access the 
Manage User Scripts dialog.

<li><strong>New Install UI</strong> - When you load a user script into the 
browser, a banner is displayed across the top of the script explaining what it 
is and giving you a chance to install. Also, stopped using the download manager 
in favor of a more subtle status menu message.

<li><strong>New Injection System</strong> - We now use <a 
href="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIXPCComponents_Utils
.html#method_evalInSandbox">evalInSandbox</a> to execute Greasemonkey scripts. 
This is more secure than the old system, but wasn't available without 
improvements which arrived in Firefox 1.5.

<li><strong>Remove script preferences when uninstalling</strong> - We now 
provide an option to remove user script preferences when uninstalling.

</ul>
